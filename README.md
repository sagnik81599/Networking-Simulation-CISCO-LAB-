📌 Overview

This repository contains a complete practical implementation of computer networking concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The project demonstrates how network devices and server-based services work together to enable communication in a real-world network.

It is designed for:

Academic learning

Practical lab understanding

Viva & interview preparation

Concept revision for beginners
------------------------------------------------------

🧱 Network Devices Implemented
🔹 Hub

Operates at Physical Layer (OSI Layer 1)

Broadcasts data to all connected devices

No MAC address learning

Used to understand basic signal transmission

🔹 Switch

Operates at Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)

Maintains a MAC address table

Sends data only to the intended destination

Reduces network congestion

🔹 Router

Operates at Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)

Connects multiple networks

Uses IP addressing for packet forwarding

Enables inter-network communication
---------------------------------------------------------
🖥️ Server Services Configured
📁 FTP Server (File Transfer Protocol)

Used for file upload and download

Operates on TCP Port 21

Requires authentication (username & password)

Demonstrates centralized file sharing

📧 Email Server

Supports:

SMTP – Sending emails

POP3 / IMAP – Receiving emails

Simulates real-time email communication between users

Demonstrates client-server communication

🌐 DHCP Server

Automatically assigns:

IP Address

Subnet Mask

Default Gateway




Eliminates manual IP configuration

Improves network efficiency and scalability
